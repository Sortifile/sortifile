I am creating an application to automate file organization based on user habits. You will receive a user's form responses detailing their preferences for organizing folders. Based on these responses and recognized best practices for file management, your task is to generate a set of rules (`rule.json`) that reflect the user's preferences and structure them in a specified format. These rules will be used by the AI to organize files and create a structured, logical, and user-friendly directory structure.

Please use the data below to generate a `rule.json` file for my automated file organization application, ensuring the output meets the following requirements:

1. **Index Section**: Include the final scores (0–10) for the three classification indicators: "Sorting Entropy," "Naming Complexity," and "Archival Tendency."
2. **Spec Section**: Summarize the user's responses from `form_question.json` and `form_respond.json` to extract quantifiable or specific settings (e.g., file types, folder depth).
3. **Natural Language Rules Section**: Combine the user's preferences with recognized best practices for file organization, listing about 5–10 comprehensive file organization rules.

### Input Data

1. **`form_question.json`**

   - Contains the questionnaire's questions, options, and the corresponding `rule.json` field mapping (`rule_mapping`).
   - Purpose: To provide the design intent of the questions (`design_purpose`) to help map responses to the final file organization rules.

2. **`form_respond.json`**
   - Contains the user's responses to the questionnaire.
   - Purpose: To adjust index scores (`index`), specify settings (`spec`), and establish file organization rules based on the user's preferences.

### Three Classification Index Score Range

Determine the user's preferences for the following three indicators and assign final quantifiable scores (0–10) in the `Index` section. Use the descriptions below for guidance in interpreting user needs or tendencies.

1. **Sorting Entropy (0–10)**
   - 0: Highly intuitive classification, minimal adherence to fixed structures.
   - 1–3: Basic categorization only when necessary. Personal needs take precedence.
   - 4–6: Balanced approach between intuition and structure.
   - 7–9: Highly structured based on file types or purposes, with minor modifications if needed.
   - 10: Completely systematic, no improvisation or ad-hoc changes allowed.
2. **Naming Complexity (0–10)**
   - 0: Use only numbers or extremely brief names.
   - 1–3: Use short references or abbreviations for quick recognition.
   - 4–6: Include essential details (e.g., short project names, dates).
   - 7–9: Provide more extensive filenames (detailed dates, version numbers, key descriptors).
   - 10: Fully detailed filenames including all possible relevant info.
3. **Archival Tendency (0–10)**
   - 0: No long-term archiving considerations; prioritize immediate accessibility.
   - 1–3: Only limited archiving for important or frequently used files.
   - 4–6: Balance file accessibility with basic archival needs.
   - 7–9: Systematically archive and maintain files for long-term stability.
   - 10: Fully adopt a strict archiving methodology to ensure maximum preservation.

### Output Format

generate the `rule.json` file in the specified format.

```json
{
  "index": {
    "sorting_entropy": 8,
    "naming_complexity": 7,
    "archival_tendency": 3
  },
  "spec": {
    "file_types": {
      "homework": true,
      "reports": true,
      "presentations": false,
      "images": true,
      "code": false
    },
    "folder_depth": 5,
    "capacity": 30
  },
  "natural_language_rules": [
    "Files should be categorized by type and purpose, with clear folder naming.",
    "File names should include key identifiers such as dates or project titles, when relevant.",
    "Folders should not exceed a depth of 5 levels to ensure accessibility.",
    "Frequently accessed files should remain easily reachable within top-level folders."
  ]
}
```

1. **Index**
   - Assign reasonable scores based on user responses.
2. **Spec**
   - Populate quantifiable or specific details based on form responses, such as supported file types, folder depth, or capacity limits.
3. **Natural Language Rules**
   - Include at least 5–10 rules.
   - Derive these rules by thinking about how the user might categorize files and summarize those preferences into clear guidelines.
   - Incorporate user preferences and general best practices (e.g., consistency, clarity, searchability).

### Additional Notes

1. **Output JSON only**: Avoid extra strings or additional explanations.
2. **Content reflects user responses**: The file should align with the user's preferences as outlined in the questionnaire and integrate general principles of file organization.
